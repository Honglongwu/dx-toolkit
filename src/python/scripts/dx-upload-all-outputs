''' This helper script uploads all output files from the virtual machine
running in the cloud to the cloud filesystem (S3).

Assumption
  * we are uploading a flat directory structure
  * located in /out

Design
  
TODO

Issues
  * testing
  * recursive directory upload, or flat support only? 
  * How do we set the output directory, so it will work for local cases as well? 
    Should we use chroot?
