Applets, Apps, and Jobs
+++++++++++++++++++++++

To create an applet or app from scratch, we encourage you to use the
command-line tools `dx-app-wizard
<http://wiki.dnanexus.com/Building-Your-First-DNAnexus-App>`_ and
`dx-build-app <http://wiki.dnanexus.com/DxBuildApp>`_.  Handlers
for applets, apps, and jobs are also available, and are probably most
useful for running executables and monitoring their resulting jobs.
