Applets, Apps, and Jobs
+++++++++++++++++++++++

To create an executable (applet or app) from scratch, we encourage you to use
the command-line tools `dx-app-wizard
<http://wiki.dnanexus.com/Building-Your-First-DNAnexus-App>`_ and
`dx-build-applet <http://wiki.dnanexus.com/DxBuildApplet>`_ (or `dx-build-app
<http://wiki.dnanexus.com/DxBuildApp>`_).

The following handlers for applets, apps, and jobs are most useful for running
preexisting executables and monitoring their resulting jobs.

.. automodule:: dxpy.bindings.dxapplet
   :members:
   :undoc-members:
   :show-inheritance:

.. automodule:: dxpy.bindings.dxapp
   :members:
   :undoc-members:
   :show-inheritance:

.. automodule:: dxpy.bindings.dxjob
   :members:
   :undoc-members:
   :show-inheritance:
