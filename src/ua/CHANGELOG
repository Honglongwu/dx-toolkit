DNAnexus Upload Agent 1.2.11 <support@dnanexus.com>, 2013-May-3
---------------------------------------------------------------
  * [PTFM-6706] Use c-ares's ares_gethostbyname() to resolve ip address explicitly on 
    linux/mac, and gethostbyname() on windows. Also, added a new command line flag
    "--no-round-robin-dns" to disable this behavior.
  * Round robin DNS also works on windows
  * Adding special "User-Agent" string for UA compilation on older kernels
  * Some minor changes

DNAnexus Upload Agent 1.2.10 <support@dnanexus.com>, 2013-May-1
---------------------------------------------------------------
  * [PTFM-6706] UA now uses gethostbyname to do explicit DNS round robin
    (only for Linux & Mac versions).
  * [PTFM-6669] Uploading files >2GB should work on windows now.
  * UA should exit normally  when --help is used.
  * Fix for "file" command on old system (since they lack --mime-type flag)
  * Windows version will remain on libcurl 7.27 (UA with 7.30 fails to make libcurl
    requests properly for some reason). For that relaxed the relevant condition in main.cpp
  * Various other minor fixes

DNAnexus Upload Agent 1.2.9 <support@dnanexus.com>, 2013-Apr-22
---------------------------------------------------------------
  * Minor bug fix

DNAnexus Upload Agent 1.2.8 <support@dnanexus.com>, 2013-Apr-22
---------------------------------------------------------------
  * [PTFM-7251] SIGPIPE bug fix (UA crashed mysteriously sometime with exit code: 141)
  * Using libcurl version 7.30 (forcing UA to use >= 7.30, so that we ensure that we make transition on all platforms)
    Also --version flag now prints Boost and libcurl versions
  * Capping maximum number of (default) compress threads to 8
  * Support for DX_LIBCURL_VERBOSE is added
  * More detailed error message is read from libcurl when /UPLOAD request fails
  * chunk::log() now accepts level as a configurable param
  * Setting CURLOPT_TIMEOUT to unlimited (0) in /UPLOAD route too

DNAnexus Upload Agent 1.2.7 <support@dnanexus.com>, 2013-Mar-14
---------------------------------------------------------------
  * Relevant JIRA tickets: PTFM-4459, PTFM-6628, PTFM-6629
  * Compiling UA with "-O3" flag now
  * Fix a thread race condition while printing error message
    for bad_alloc case
  * Append null gzipped bytes for chunks compressing less than 5MB
    (instead of previous behavior of compressing at level 0)
  * Bug fix: Average transfer rate was incorrectly reported when
    file compression was on

DNAnexus Upload Agent 1.2.6 <support@dnanexus.com>, 2013-Mar-12
---------------------------------------------------------------
  * https://github.com/dnanexus/dx-toolkit/commit/bd7d2fa306aa90fd06580cfc86fabc94b64d9772
    - User Agent string of Upload Agent is updated to include platform
      (and also dxcpp/dxhttp version for /UPLOAD requests)
    - Added some sleep() to compress/read/upload threads, to ensure
      that we yield to other threads
    - Using DXLOG for logging in Upload Agent now
  * New default values for chunk-size, number of threads (upload/read/compress)
  * Catch std::bad_alloc (and print a meaningful error message)
  * Catch the "schannel" (curl code: 35) error, and show the URL to download relevant hotfix from Microsoft.
  * Progress bar is now refreshed every 1sec (compared to previous 0.25sec)

DNAnexus Upload Agent 1.2.5 <support@dnanexus.com>, 2013-Feb-25
